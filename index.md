## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Topics within the lab revolves around bioanalytical chemistry and its applications to answer relevant clinical questions such as immunoglobulin signature investigation in immunoglobulin-specific diseases, LC-MS/MS method development for quantification of immunoglobulins and glycosylation mapping, proteomics and glycoproteomics, metabolomics, and using multi-omics for discovery diagnostic and prognostic disease markers in blood, urine and exosomes.
